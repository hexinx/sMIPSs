Petrinet Simulator for a simplified MIPS processor.

Description taken from project assignment description:
In this project you will create a Petri Net simulator for a simplified MIPS Processor. The model will use colored tokens (token with values) rather
than the default Petri net. Your simulator should be able to generate step-by-step simulation of the Petri net model of the MIPS processor described below
